# Churn Analysis Project

This repository contains an end-to-end solution for analyzing customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning. The project identifies key churn indicators and builds a predictive model to proactively address customer retention strategies. The model is deployed using Flask for web-based interaction.

## Features

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performed using `eda_analysis.ipynb`.
   - Includes data cleaning, visualization, and feature selection.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented in `model_building.ipynb`.
   - Uses machine learning algorithms to predict churn.
   - Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. **Web Application:**
   - Built with Flask (`app.py`).
   - Provides an interface for users to upload data and view churn predictions.
